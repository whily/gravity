Development
-----------

The following tools are needed to build Gravity from source:

* JDK version 6/7 from <http://www.java.com> if Java is not available. 
  Note that JDK is preinstalled on Mac OS X and available via package manager
  on many Linux systems. 
* Scala (2.10.0)
* sbt (0.12.4)
  
The project follows general sbt architecture, therefore normal sbt
commands can be used to build the library: compile, test, etc.
